# 2021-summer-intern-coding-challange

Welcome to the coding challange of our AktiaSummer Recruitment event.

In this 1,5 hours workshop we invite you to write some code and have some fun :-). The workshop starts at 4:30 pm and ends at 6 pm. Some of the speed dating interviews are scheduled during this time, so feel free to leave and come back as you wish.

You have two smaller and two, somewhat larger tasks. We suggest you to try to solve the first two (Task #1 - fuel problem and Task #2 - IntCode) during the workshop. Since your availability might be limited due to the speed dating interviews, these tasks are not scored, they are only for programming fun :-). Since both of these problems are asking for a single number as solution, we will reveal the results at the end of the workshop, so you can check your solution.

We invite you to pick one of the larger tasks, solve it at home and **submit your solution to Matti in email (Matti.K.Lindroth at aktia.fi)**. These solutions will be scored and can give you extra points when hiring decision is made.

If you have any questions feel free to write to the group chat or contact Tuomas (Finnish or English) or Tamas (only in English) directly. We are here to help you!

I hope you enjoy this coding challange with us. Happy coding!
